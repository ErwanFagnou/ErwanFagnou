<p>I am currently a <strong>PhD student</strong> at LAMSADE (Université Paris Dauphine-PSL, Paris, France) under the supervision of Alexandre Allauzen. I am part of the MILES team which is dedicated to machine learning. </p>
        <p>My research is about <strong>frugal machine learning</strong>: I aim at making deep learning models more resource-efficient while maintaining their performance — the term "resource" referring for instance to time, memory, money, carbon emissions, etc. The PhD focuses mainly on transformers applied to NLP, as they are by far the most resource-consuming models in the field (hello ChatGPT). This is still a very broad topic, and multiple angles of attack are considered — from the architecture of the models to the optimization algorithm used to train them.</p>
