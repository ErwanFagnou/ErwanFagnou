ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I am currently a machine learning student, doing my last year before graduating a Master of Science, at the Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure Paris-Saclay (MVA Master), and TÃ©lÃ©com Paris, in France. I am passionate about many fields of artificial intelligence, and love doing projects (either for school or for fun), involving different fields of deep learning. My favorite areas are reinforcement learning (either theoretical or more applied), optimization in deep learning, and more generally the mathematics behind deep learning.

Unfortunately, most of my projects are in private repositories, for various reasons... but I wrote detailed reports for my best projects, which you can find on my website:

And more generally you can find further details about me there!
